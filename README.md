# Regex Nodes

[This project is a node-based online editor](https://johannesvollmer.github.io/regex-nodes-js/) which allows you do learn, deconstruct, and build [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions). 

Because I am currently rewriting this project in elm, this javascript code is truly messy and unethical.
